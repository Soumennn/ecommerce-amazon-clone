# Amazon Clone 

***A few lines to let the visitors understand the structure of the app:***

- Using [Fake Store API ( REST Architecture )](https://fakestoreapi.com/) with `React.Js` to generate
products to be purchased.
- Using `NEXT.Js` to handle both frontend and backend development with
the help of components, hooks, and endpoint pages.
- Using Tailwind CSS, CSS grids & flexboxes to handle the
responsiveness
- Using `Stripe` Merchant for integrating payment for the generated orders
and also using webhooks via Stripe CLI to store the purchase history for
the user in the web app.
- Using `NextAuth's Google-Auth` to implement authentication and
sessions to serialize and deserialize users
- Storing the user's order history and transaction information using
`Firebase` as the database.
